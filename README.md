## Project Objective
This project aims to build a book recommender system using the Book Crossing Dataset. The system leverages both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches to provide book recommendations to users.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Book Crossing Dataset, which was compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in 2004. The dataset consists of three main tables:

- Users: Information about the users.

- Books: Information about the books, including title, author, and publication details.

- Ratings: User ratings for books. Explicit ratings are on a scale of 1-10, while implicit ratings are represented by a value of 0.

## Technologies and Libraries
The project is implemented in Python and makes use of several popular data science and machine learning libraries:

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the dataset's DataFrames.

- Numpy: Essential for numerical operations and array manipulation.

- Scikit-learn: The NearestNeighbors and pairwise_distances modules are used to implement the collaborative filtering logic.

- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

## Key Project Steps
The Jupyter notebook demonstrates the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The raw CSV files are loaded into pandas DataFrames, and initial data cleaning is performed to handle malformed entries and irrelevant columns.

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The datasets are prepared for the recommender system models. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and merging the different tables.

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** The core of the recommendation engine is built using collaborative filtering techniques to find similar users and items.

1. **Recommendation Generation:** The final step involves generating a list of recommended books for a given user or based on a specific book.
